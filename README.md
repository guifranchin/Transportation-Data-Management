# Transportation Data Management

This is a backend system developed with Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Lombok and PostgreSQL. The goal of this project is to provide a robust and reliable platform for managing company data. The system was developed using the mentioned technologies to ensure high performance, security and ease of maintenance.

The system has various functionalities such as registering, editing, listing, detailing and deleting entities, as well as managing relationships between these entities. It also has integrations with other systems and external services, which further expands its possibilities of use.

The project was developed following best programming practices and is structured in a way that makes maintenance and improvement of functionalities easier. In addition, the Spring Boot framework was used, which has a series of tools and resources that make development faster and more efficient.

Hibernate was used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to facilitate access to data stored in the PostgreSQL database. Lombok, in turn, was used to minimize the amount of code required to implement the system's functionalities.

In summary, this project is a complete and reliable platform for managing company data, developed with cutting-edge technologies and following best programming practices.
